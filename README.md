Drug development is a lengthy and highly costly
endeavor, often with limited success and high risk. The objective
of drug repositioning is to apply existing drugs to different
diseases or medical conditions than the original target, and thus
alleviate to a certain extent the time and cost expended. The area
of drug repositioning is a suitable application area for computational
intelligence because numerous online databases containing
technical information on drug targets, protein interactions, sideeffects
and biological knowledge are freely available. Thus insilico
analysis can be used as a useful first stage to screen potential
candidate drugs for possible redeployment. This paper takes the
position that drugs with side-effects are potential candidates for
use elsewhere, it is a case of identifying potential diseases that may
benefit from this re-deployment. The system uses graph based
computational techniques to analyze drugs with known sideeffects
and compares the proteins involved in these side-effects
with proteins known to be identified with other diseases. Our
intention is to find potential candidates for treating Alzheimer’s
disease.
