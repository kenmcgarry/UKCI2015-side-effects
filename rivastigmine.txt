CYP2D6	9606.ENSP00000353820	cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily D, polypeptide 6; Responsible for the metabolism of many drugs and environmental chemicals that it oxidizes. It is involved in the metabolism of drugs such as antiarrhythmics, adrenoceptor antagonists, and tricyclic antidepressants
ACHE	9606.ENSP00000303211	acetylcholinesterase (Yt blood group); Terminates signal transduction at the neuromuscular junction by rapid hydrolysis of the acetylcholine released into the synaptic cleft. Role in neuronal apoptosis
BCHE	9606.ENSP00000264381	butyrylcholinesterase
HSF1	9606.ENSP00000332698	heat shock transcription factor 1; DNA-binding protein that specifically binds heat shock promoter elements (HSE) and activates transcription. In higher eukaryotes, HSF is unable to bind to the HSE unless the cells are heat shocked
CYP3A4	9606.ENSP00000337915	cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4; Cytochromes P450 are a group of heme-thiolate monooxygenases. In liver microsomes, this enzyme is involved in an NADPH-dependent electron transport pathway. It performs a variety of oxidation reactions (e.g. caffeine 8-oxidation, omeprazole sulphoxidation, midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and midazolam 4- hydroxylation) of structurally unrelated compounds, including steroids, fatty acids, and xenobiotics. The enzyme also hydroxylates etoposide
